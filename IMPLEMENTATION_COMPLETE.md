## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### Build Error Resolution
**Problem**: `habitId` shadowing caused compilation error
```swift
// ❌ Before (caused error)
if let habitId = habitId, let habit = ... {
    Button(action: { habitId = nil }) // Error: habitId is 'let' constant
}

// ✅ After (fixed)
if let currentHabitId = habitId, let habit = ... {
    Button(action: { habitId = nil }) // Works: habitId is the @State var
}
```

## 📊 Build Status

### Final Build Result

** BUILD SUCCEEDED **
```

### Warnings (Non-Critical)
- Some deprecated iOS 17 `onChange` modifiers (pre-existing)
- Unused variables in other views (pre-existing)
