# Notes Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully reorganized the AnotherLife app by moving the weekly report analytics to the Profile tab and replacing the Analytics tab with a new Notes/Journal feature.

## Changes Made

### 1. **New Notes Model** (`Models/Models.swift`)

  - `id`: Unique identifier
  - `content`: Note text content
  - `date`: Date associated with the note
  - `habitId`: Optional link to a specific habit
  - `tags`: Array of tags for categorization
  - `createdAt` & `updatedAt`: Timestamps
- Added computed properties:
  - `wordCount`: Counts words in the note
  - `preview`: Returns truncated preview (max 100 chars)

### 2. **Notes Management in HabitManager** (`Managers/HabitManager.swift`)
Added comprehensive notes management functionality:
- **Storage**: Added `@Published var notes: [HabitNote]` array
- **CRUD Operations**:
  - `addNote(_:)`: Create new note
  - `updateNote(_:)`: Update existing note

### 4. **Note Editor View** (`Views/Habits/NoteEditorView.swift`)
Comprehensive note creation and editing interface:
- **Date Picker**: Graphical date picker to set note date

  - Optional habit linking
  - Shows habit picker sheet with all habits
  - Can unlink habit if needed

### 5. **Profile View Enhancement** (`Views/Profile/ProfileView.swift`)
Added comprehensive analytics section:
- **Weekly Report Button**:
  - Gradient background (Blue to Purple)
  - Opens WeeklyReportView in sheet
  - Shows "Detailed insights and progress"
- **Performance Analytics**:
  - This Week's Performance with progress bar
  - Current Streak display
  - Total Completed This Week counter
- **Statistics**:
  - Added `totalCompletedThisWeek` computed property
  - Calculates weekly completion stats

### 6. **Main Content View Update** (`Views/Main/ContentView.swift`)
- **Replaced Analytics Tab** with Notes Tab:
  - Changed icon from "chart.bar.fill" to "note.text"
  - Changed label from "Analytics" to "Notes"
  - Now shows `NotesTabView()` instead of `AnalyticsView()`
